# Crafting Interpreters

Repository with the code/documentation of the crafting interpreters book/website.

The book/website is found here:  
https://craftinginterpreters.com/

## Information

Two interpreters will be created in Java and in C (maybe the Java one is reimplemented in Python later).
Challenges will be implemented in a copy of the interpreters as created according to the crafting interpreters book.

## Installation

Perform the following to install the dependencies of this repository (assuming an Arch Linux installation):

```bash
sudo pacman -S caddy jdk-openjdk less xdg-utils
```

## TODO

- continue from `III. A Bytecode Virtual Machine - 14.`
- after the Java/C interpreters, add Python one with (all?) the challenges implemented
