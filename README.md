# Crafting Interpreters

Repository with the code/documentation of the crafting interpreters book/website.

The book/website is found here:  
https://craftinginterpreters.com/

## Information

Two interpreters will be created in Java and in C (maybe the Java one is reimplemented in Python later).
Challenges will be implemented in a copy of the interpreters as created according to the crafting interpreters book.

## TODO

- add separate projects for the challenges already?
